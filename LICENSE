fabfile.py
----------

Some parts of fabfile.py have been largely inspired by code published by
Caktus Consulting Group, LCC here:

http://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2010/04/22/basic-django-deployment-with-virtualenv-fabric-pip-and-rsync/
https://bitbucket.org/copelco/caktus-deployment/src/6ad8ad84a938/example-django-project/caktus_website/fabfile.py

I don't know how much code from them remain in the fabfile.py, but for what it's wort, here's the license:
